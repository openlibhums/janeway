        Its a common myth that a short and complex password
        (Jfjfy&65^87) is more secure than a long and uncomplicated password
        (our awesome moon base rocks).
      {% endblocktrans %}</p>
      <p>{% blocktrans %}
        We recommend selecting a long, but easy to remember
        password such as our awesome moon base rocks which would take an
        estimated septillion years to crack as opposed to a complex one like
        Jfjfy&65^87 which would take just over 600 years on a standard
        computer.
