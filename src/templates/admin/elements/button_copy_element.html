  A button sytled to recede that lets users copy
  the text content of a DOM element (by ID) to their clipboard.

  element_id - the ID of the element to copy from
  Button text is always 'Copy' and changes to 'Copied' on success.

  Requires src/static/common/js/clipboard.js to be included in the JS block of any page using this button.
  For example, the article.html template uses this several times, and includes that script.

    {% include "elements/icons/copy.html" %}
</button>
