# Origin of this TinyMCE skin

I created this skin using the tool for TinyMCE v5 located here:
http://skin.tiny.cloud/t5/

I clicked “Advanced Mode” in the Styles section so that I could edit the
preprocessor variables and save it. After writing in the Janeway colors,
I copy-pasted it into `tinymce-alpha/variables.less`.

This custom skin now is selected by default in `janeway_global_settings.css`.
