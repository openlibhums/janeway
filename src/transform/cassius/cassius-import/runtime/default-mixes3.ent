     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
     
     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite 
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov. 

     Details on version 3.0 are available at 
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

                        Inline elements appear only inside a

                        paragraph or at the same level as a 
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a 
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material 
                        will have restricted such elements to only

                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      -->
