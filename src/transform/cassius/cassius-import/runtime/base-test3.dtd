Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
     
     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite 
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov. 

     Details on version 3.0 are available at 
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

<!--                    Declares all the external modules that are  
                        part of the modular Journal Archiving and 
                        Interchange DTD Suite library. Thus it does
                        NOT declare itself; the DTD-specific 
                        module-of-modules; any DTD-specific class,
                        mix, or model over-ride modules; or any new
                        new content modules specific to this DTD.
                        Those are declared in the DTD-specific
                        module of modules.
                           Since this module declares but does not
                        invoke modules, this DTD then invokes any
                        modules it uses by referencing the external 
                        Parameter Entities defined in the Module of
                        Modules. To include a set of elements (such 
                        as all the lists or the MathML elements) this 
                        module defines the external Parameter Entity
                        for the module(s) that contains the MathML
                        declarations and the DTD references that 
                        entity.                                    -->

                        Which version of the DTD does this article
                        use? The value is a #FIXED attribute, so
                        the entire attribute definition is defined
                        in a Parameter Entity, so the next version
                        of the DTD can use a different #FIXED value.
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "fr" (French), "en" (English),
                        and "de" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". 
                        Processing and Conversion Note: All other
                        xml:lang attributes within the article
                        inherit the value set on <article> unless
                        explicitly set themselves with their own
                        "xml:lang" attribute.                      
             xmlns      Set up the pseudo-attributes for the
                        namespaces for any namespaces used in this
                        DTD.  XLink and MathML are set up in the
                        MathML modules. These xmlns are called
                        here because certain older tools will not
                        work properly with namespaces unless they
                        are declared on the top level element.
                        The PEs are defined in the MathML modules. -->

                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "fr" (French), "en" (English),

<!--                    Reply, response, or commentary concerning the
                        journal article. In the typical case, the
                        response is included in the same XML package 
                        as the original article, and thus attached 
                        at the end of the article proper.
                        Authoring Note: Frequently a reply or
                        response is an article in its own right, not
                        included as part of the original article.
                        Such an article could use the 
                        <related-article> element in the article 
                        metadata to record the metadata for the 
                        original article.     
                        Conversion Note: This construction can also
                        be used for the pathological case, rarely
                        seen, in which several responses to an 
                        article are lumped together into a single
                        container which is not the original article,
                        merely a collection of responses. In one
                        example we examined, the first two responses
                        were to an original article which was else-
                        where and the third response was a response
                        to the first two responses.                -->
