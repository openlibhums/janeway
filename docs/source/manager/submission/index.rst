- You can enable or disable almost all fields, except Title, Manuscript Files and Authors.

Additional Submission Fields
----------------------------
The additional submission fields page allows us to add custom fields to the Article Info submission page. It works in a similar fashion to the Review Forms generator.

Field types are:

- Text Field
- Text Area
- Checkbox
- Select (dropdown)
- Email
- Upload
- Date

To add a new Element:

- In the form add Name and select a Kind
    - If you choose "select" as kind you will need to add the options to the Choices field, these should be seperated by the bar "|" characted e.g. choice 1|choice 2|choice 2 or 1|2|3|4|5 if you wanted a numeric choice. If you select any other Kind, ignore the Choices field.
- Required
    - If this field MUST be completed, ensure this box is checked, if it is optional make sure it is not checked
- Order
    - The order in which this element will appear on the form
- Width
    - 1/3, 1/2 or Full width. If you put two half width elements next to each other in order they will both display on the same line
- Help text
    - This text will display under the Name field on the form and explain what the reviewer needs to do with this field.
