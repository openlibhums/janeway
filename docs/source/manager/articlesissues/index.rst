Articles and Issues
===================


Article Display Settings
------------------------
The Article Display Settings page has settings for controlling the way articles look and for deciding how metrics are displayed.

- Disable Article Images
- Display Guest Editors
- Suppress How to Cite
- View PDF Option
- Disable Metrics Display
- Suppress Citation Metrics

How To Cite is an auto-generated citation based on a custom OLH citation style.  Note that a previous version of the citation included "p" before page ranges. To get this back, enter a custom value in Page Numbers in the Edit Metadata pane for each article.

You can suppress How To Cite for all articles with Suppress How To Cite. You can also override it for individual articles by entering a custom citation in the Edit Metadata pane for each article.

Article Images Manager
----------------------
The article images manager pulls is an interface for editing all of the images for a given article.

- Large Image File
    - The large image is a file used in the heading of the article page on some themes. It is resized to 720x324 px upon uploading so it is recommended an image be either this size or larger. This image will also be used as the meta image if none is supplied and will be used on the carousel when Article display is enabled there.
- Thumbnail
    - The thumbnail is displayed on article listing pages like the All Articles list or the Issue Articles list,
- Meta Image
    - The meta image allows you to override the image displayed when the article is shared on social media. If no meta image is supplied the large image file is used.

In addition, if the issue has guest editors you can add them using the Guest Editor manager at the bottom of the Issue page.

Projected Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Janeway allows editors to mark articles as projected to be published within a given issue. This can be done in the Editor Assignment stage by using the "Assign Projected Issue" button.

.. warning:: Assigning an article a projected issue is not the same as assigning an article directly to an issue. Projected issues are used mainly for internal tracking.

.. figure:: ../../nstatic/assign_projected_issue_link.png

    On the Editor Assignment screen you can see which issue an article is projected to be in.

On the projected issue screen you can select, from a drop down, the issue you expect the article to be published in.
