Janeway Documentation
=====================

This guide, whilst not exhaustive, provides various guides for running articles through the workflow, configuring journals and setting up an install of Janeway - making the process as usable and accessible as possible. However, we are always open to suggestions to improve these guides and Janeway more broadly.

This guide has been written to avoid using language like "easy", "just" or "simply". A massive shout out to Emma Barnes and her awesome site https://www.justsimply.dev/
