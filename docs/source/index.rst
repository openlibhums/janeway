Janeway Documentation
=====================

Janeway is a digital platform for publishing scholarly articles online, from submission and review to editing, production and final publication. This guide, whilst not exhaustive, provides various guides for setting up an install of Janeway, configuring journals and running articles through the workflow

This guide has been written to avoid using language like "easy", "just" or "simply". A massive shout out to Emma Barnes and her awesome site https://www.justsimply.dev/
