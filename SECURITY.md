# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently only support one major version of Janeway. The master development branch becomes the next major release of Janeway and receives security support. Security issues that only affect the master branch and not any stable released versions can be reported as Bugs and are fixed in public. Security vulnerabilities that effect a support branch, listed below, should be reported using the details provided under Reporting a Vulnerability.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.7.x   | âœ… |

| 1.4.x   | :x: |
| 1.3.x   | :x: |
| <1.2.x   | :x:               |

## Advanced Notification
The full list of people and organizations who receive advance notification of security issues is not and will not be made public.

On a case by case basis we may notify individuals and organisations who collaborate in the development of Janeway.
